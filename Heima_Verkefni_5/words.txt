According 
to 
research
at 
Cambridge 
University, 
it 
doesn't 
matter 
in 
what 
order 
the 
letters 
in 
a 
word 
are, 
the 
only 
important 
thing 
is 
that 
the 
first 
and 
last 
letter 
be 
at 
the 
right 
place. 
The 
rest 
can 
be 
a 
total 
mess 
and 
you 
can 
still 
read 
it 
without 
problem. 
This 
is 
because 
the 
human 
mind 
does 
not 
read 
every 
letter 
by 
itself 
but 
the 
word 
as 
a 
whole.
